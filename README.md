# Prediction of Diabetes Mellitus Empowered with Unified Machine Learning Techniques
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes by integrating multiple machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy. By combining the strengths of various models, the system provides a robust assessment based on input medical data.

## Overview
Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. This project leverages machine learning to provide an early prediction mechanism by analyzing relevant medical parameters.

## Features
- **Unified Model Approach**: Combines multiple machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Web-based application for easy input and result visualization.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Instant analysis and feedback based on user input.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which includes various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.
