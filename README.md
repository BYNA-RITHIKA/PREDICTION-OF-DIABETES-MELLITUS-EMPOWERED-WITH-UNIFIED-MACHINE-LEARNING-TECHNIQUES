# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a patient having Diabetes Mellitus using a unified approach that integrates multiple machine learning algorithms. By combining the strengths of various models, the system delivers a more accurate and reliable prediction based on input medical data.

To enhance the user experience, the project features:

ðŸ“Š An interactive dashboard that presents results in a clear and graphical format.

ðŸ¥— Personalized diet recommendations based on the user's region in India to support diabetes management.

ðŸ¤– A chatbot powered by ChatGPT (OpenAI) to assist users with questions related to diabetes, lifestyle, and the platform.

This intelligent, user-friendly system not only aids in early detection but also promotes informed decision-making and proactive health management.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the [PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database), which includes various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.
